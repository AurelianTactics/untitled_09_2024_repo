        see 11/13 email throughts from the batch
	
DONE reread the 11/13 email thoughts

DONE try a base version with cop;ilot
	still incredibly terrible

focus more on what the base version can do
	better prompting on base
	eval cases for langsmith
	langsmith
	simple UI

make a minimal version
	eval where it goes wrong
	improve from there
